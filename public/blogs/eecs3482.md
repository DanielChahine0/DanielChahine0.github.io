## Introduction to Cybersecurity

Modern life is deeply reliant on digital systems. From banking and healthcare to traffic control and social media, we depend on software infrastructure to function reliably. As technology becomes more accessible and interconnected, especially after the rapid digitization triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, cybersecurity has become critical.

Cyberattacks are not rare occurrences; they happen constantly and continue to evolve in sophistication. The core issue lies in software, which is at the heart of every major system. When software is insecure, the consequences can be devastating. Vulnerabilities often stem from human error, overconfidence, stress, or even malicious intent. Software complexity also introduces potential for failure, and incorporating code from untrusted sources increases the risk.

The financial cost of cybercrime is staggering. By 2025, global damages are expected to reach \$10.5 trillion annually, up from \$3 trillion in 2015. A single data breach can cost millions—averaging \$4.45M globally, \$9.48M in the US, and \$10.93M in healthcare.

This rise in vulnerabilities is reflected in databases like the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE), Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE), and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), which track flaws and risks across digital ecosystems.

Motivations for attackers vary. Financial gain is the most common driver, involving tactics such as botnets, ransomware, and stolen credentials. Underground markets enable the sale of compromised systems and exploits. Some attackers act for practice, political reasons, or internal sabotage, such as the 2003 Linux kernel trapdoor incident.

## Foundations of Computer Security

Computer security is the practice of protecting system assets—hardware, software, and data—by ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Confidentiality prevents unauthorized access to information. Integrity ensures data remains accurate and trustworthy. Availability guarantees that resources are accessible when needed.

Additional principles include authenticity, accountability, nonrepudiation, and anonymity. Authenticity verifies identity or origin. Accountability links actions to users. Nonrepudiation ensures that individuals cannot deny their actions. Anonymity aims to mask identity and unlink user behavior from specific individuals.

Computer security presents several challenges. While concepts like the CIA triad are easy to define, implementing them is complex. Security must resist real-world attacks, yet controls often seem excessive or unintuitive. Placing security measures in the right locations is difficult, and managing cryptographic keys remains a notorious challenge. Attackers only need one weakness, while defenders must address all. Security is frequently added too late in the design phase or underestimated until after a breach occurs. Usability conflicts with strict security, and ongoing vigilance is required due to the evolving threat landscape.

Ken Thompson’s classic work, "Reflections on Trusting Trust," challenges the assumptions we make about trust in systems, highlighting that threats may exist at any level—from the operating system and BIOS to compilers and hardware.

Essential terminology includes adversary (the threat actor), attack (the method used), countermeasure (the defense), risk (likelihood and impact), threat (the potential for harm), vulnerability (the flaw), and asset (the target or resource).

Security professionals build models to evaluate these risks. A threat model identifies potential attackers, their capabilities, and the vectors they might exploit. A risk model combines these with likelihood and impact to prioritize mitigation strategies.

Depending on the threat, its impact can be classified as low (minor disruption), moderate (serious disruption), or high (catastrophic failure).

## Understanding Assets, Threats, and Attack Vectors

Computer and network systems consist of assets like hardware, software, data, and communication lines. These are constantly under threat in terms of availability, confidentiality, and integrity. For instance, deleted files or equipment theft impact availability; unauthorized access breaches confidentiality; message tampering or falsification compromises integrity.

Threats exploit vulnerabilities to cause harm. Attacks put these threats into action and are categorized as either passive or active. Passive attacks, such as eavesdropping and traffic analysis, do not alter resources. Active attacks include data modification, denial of service, and identity spoofing. Attackers may be insiders with legitimate access or outsiders infiltrating from external sources.

Consequences of attacks fall into four categories. Unauthorized disclosure involves data exposure through methods like interception or intrusion. Deception occurs when false data is accepted as valid. Disruption targets service availability. Usurpation results in unauthorized control over resources.

Attack surfaces represent all exploitable entry points in a system. These include open ports, web forms, data-processing channels (e.g., email and XML), and social engineering risks. Attack surfaces span network-level vulnerabilities (e.g., protocol exploits), software issues (e.g., OS bugs), and human errors.

Real-world attacks highlight the danger. Examples include JavaScript-based link tracking, keylogging malware, adversary-in-the-browser attacks, malicious SMS campaigns, typo-squatting on Python package repositories, and supply chain attacks using compromised dependencies.

## Countermeasures and Security Requirements

Security countermeasures fall into three categories: prevention, detection and response, and recovery. These aim to reduce residual risk, although no solution eliminates all threats. In some cases, new countermeasures may introduce additional vulnerabilities.

The scope of computer security includes access control, securing stored and transmitted data, and protecting entire systems and networks. To guide implementation, security frameworks such as NIST SP 800-53, ISO/IEC 27001, and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework define a wide range of requirements.

Seventeen core requirements form a comprehensive structure. These include access control, staff training, logging and accountability, periodic assessments, secure configurations, contingency planning, user authentication, incident response, system maintenance, media protection, physical safeguards, policy planning, personnel security, risk assessments, acquisition policies, secure communications, and system integrity monitoring.

Each requirement addresses a specific aspect of security, covering people, processes, and technology to enforce best practices and maintain trust in digital systems.

## Security Design Principles and Strategic Frameworks

Security design must be intentional and strategic. Foundational principles include simplicity (economy of mechanism), denial by default (fail-safe defaults), thorough access control (complete mediation), and transparency (open design). Additional best practices involve requiring multiple conditions for access (separation of privilege), minimizing access (least privilege), avoiding shared mechanisms (least common mechanism), and ensuring usability (psychological acceptability).

Security strategies should also incorporate isolation, encapsulation, modularity, layering, and user-centric behavior (least astonishment). These principles ensure that systems are defensible, maintainable, and resilient.

A robust security strategy involves defining policies, enforcing them through prevention, detection, response, and recovery mechanisms, and validating these through assurance and evaluation. Assurance refers to confidence in correct implementation, while evaluation involves formal testing and analysis.

Security is also shaped by global standards bodies. NIST provides US standards for government and private sectors. ISOC and IETF standardize internet infrastructure. ITU-T handles telecom coordination, and ISO publishes cross-industry standards. FIPS, developed by NIST, serves as the US federal baseline for information security.
